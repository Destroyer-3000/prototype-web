<h3>First Step:

      <h3>Second Step:
      </h3>
Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in a large nonstick pan until shimmering. Empty the contents of the bag into the pan and cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tander and the chicken is cooked through, or about 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in lime juice.
